/**
 * Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.
 * 
 * For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.
 * 
 * Increase the height of the tower by K
 * Decrease the height of the tower by K
 * Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.
 * 
 * You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
 * 
 * Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.
